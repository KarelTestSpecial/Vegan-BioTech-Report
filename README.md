- **AI Image Generation**: Integrated Gemini AI to generate cover images for articles.
- **Multi-language**: Generates content in English and Dutch.
- **Status Management**: Automated archiving of old content to keep the homepage fresh.

## 📂 Project Structure

- **`content/`**: Markdown content for Hugo (newsletters, longreads).
- **`pipeline/`**: Python scripts for the generation pipeline (`run_pipeline.py`, `generate_images.py`, `manage_content.py`).
- **`themes/ananke/`**: Hugo theme (submodule).
- **`static/images/`**: Generated images and assets.
- **`.github/workflows/`**: Automation workflows.

## 🛠️ Management Workflows

This project uses GitHub Actions for all management tasks. Go to the **[Actions](https://github.com/KarelTestSpecial/Vegan-BioTech-Report/actions)** tab to run them.

### 1. [AUTO] Generate Content & Deploy
The main pipeline. Fetches new data, generates text and images, creates a new site build, and deploys it. Runs automatically on schedule or manually.

### 2. [MANUAL] Run Pipeline Only
Runs the generation scripts to create new content in the repo, but *does not* deploy to the live site. Useful for reviewing content before publishing.

### 3. [MANUAL] Fill Missing Images Only
Scans all content files. If an article has no image, it generates one using Gemini and saves it to `static/images`. Does *not* change text content.

### 4. [MANUAL] Deploy Site Only
Rebuilds the Hugo site from the current `main` branch and deploys to GitHub Pages. Use this after manually editing content or fixing typos.

### 5. [UTIL] Manage Content Status
Tool to change the status of content files.
- **Archive Live Content**: Sets `archived: true` on current posts.
- **Unarchive Latest**: Brought back the last archived batch.
- **Set Specific Files**: toggles individual files.

### 6. [UTIL] View Content Status
Prints a report in the Action logs showing which files are `LIVE` and which are `ARCHIVED`.
