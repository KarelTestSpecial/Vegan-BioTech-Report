# GEMINI.md: Vegan BioTech Report Project Context

This document provides an overview of the "Vegan BioTech Report" project, its architecture, key technologies, and development conventions to serve as instructional context for future interactions.

## Project Overview

The "Vegan BioTech Report" is an automated platform designed to generate news and biotechnology reports. It leverages AI to create textual content (newsletters and longreads) and associated cover images. The generated content is then used to build a multi-language static website using Hugo, which is subsequently deployed. The project includes a robust Python-based pipeline for content generation, curation, and management, orchestrated via GitHub Actions for automation and deployment.

### Key Technologies

*   **Hugo**: Static site generator used to build the final website.
*   **Python**: Powers the entire content generation, AI integration, and content management pipeline.
*   **Gemini AI**: Utilized for drafting content and generating images based on textual prompts.
*   **GitHub Actions**: Central to the project's automation, handling content generation, site building, and deployment workflows.
*   **`python-dotenv`**: For managing environment variables (e.g., API keys) from `.env` files.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several key directories:

*   **`.github/workflows/`**: Contains YAML files defining the GitHub Actions workflows for various automated tasks.
*   **`content/`**: Stores all Markdown content generated for the Hugo website, categorized into `newsletters` and `longreads`, with further organization by timestamp.
*   **`pipeline/`**: Houses all Python scripts responsible for the content generation and management pipeline (e.g., `run_pipeline.py`, `generate_images.py`, `manage_content.py`).
*   **`prompts/`**: Contains text files used as prompts for the AI models during content generation.
*   **`reports/`**: Documentation and internal reports related to the project.
*   **`static/`**: Contains static assets, including `images/` (for generated and static images) and `css/custom.css` for custom styling.
*   **`themes/ananke/`**: The Hugo theme used for the website, included as a Git submodule.
*   **`layouts/`**: Contains custom Hugo layout templates that override or extend the base theme.

## Building and Running

### Python Content Generation Pipeline

1.  **Install Python Dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
2.  **Run the Full Pipeline**: This command executes the entire content generation process, creating new content files (Markdown) in `content/` and images in `static/images/`.
    ```bash
    python3 -m pipeline.run_pipeline
    ```
    *Note: The pipeline uses configurations from `providers.json` and requires AI API keys to be set as environment variables (e.g., in a `.env` file).*

### Hugo Local Development Server

1.  **Serve the Website Locally**: Once content has been generated by the Python pipeline, this command builds and serves the Hugo site locally for preview.
    ```bash
    hugo server
    ```

### Deployment

Deployment is primarily managed through **GitHub Actions**. The main workflow, `1-auto-generate-and-deploy.yml`, handles the end-to-end process of content generation, site building, and deployment to GitHub Pages. Other workflows exist for specific tasks like running the pipeline only, filling missing images, or deploying only. These can be triggered manually from the GitHub Actions tab.

## Development Conventions

*   **Python Scripts**: Designed to be run as modules (e.g., `python3 -m pipeline.script_name`). They load environment variables using `dotenv` and typically output errors to `stderr`.
*   **Hugo Content Structure**: Content files are organized by type (`newsletters`, `longreads`) within the `content/` directory and further by timestamped subdirectories. Content metadata is managed via frontmatter (e.g., `archived: true`).
*   **Multi-language Support**: Configured via `languages.json`, enabling content generation in multiple languages (currently English and Dutch).
*   **Styling**: Custom CSS additions are made in `static/css/custom.css` to ensure consistent readability and visual appeal.
*   **Automation**: GitHub Actions are the primary mechanism for all automated tasks, providing a structured approach to content updates and deployment.
